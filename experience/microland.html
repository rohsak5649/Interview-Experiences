  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>Microland visited our campus for placements, offering a <strong>non-technical role</strong>. The selection process consisted of multiple steps.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Step 1: Online Assessment</h2>
    <p>The first round was an online assessment conducted by the company. After clearing this, I moved on to the next stage.</p>

    <h2>📱 Step 2: Mobile App-Based Communication Test</h2>
    <p>Candidates were required to download a mobile application where they completed <strong>three communication-based tests</strong>. Each test was scored out of 600 marks, and it was compulsory to score above 450 to qualify for the final round. I successfully cleared this stage.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ Final Interview</h2>
    <p>The final interview was focused on assessing our suitability for the role. The interviewer informed me that the offered role was <strong>completely non-technical</strong>. They asked:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “The role is non-technical. Are you comfortable with that?”
    </blockquote>
    <p>I responded honestly, saying that my interest lies in <strong>technical and coding roles</strong>, and hence I would prefer to pursue opportunities aligned with my goals.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This experience helped me understand the importance of aligning opportunities with career goals. Even though I was not selected, I stayed true to my passion for coding and software development.</p>
