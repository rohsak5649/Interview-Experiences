    <h2>1️⃣ Application Process</h2>
    <p>I applied off-campus, and after my resume was shortlisted, I received a phone call from HR to discuss my application.</p>

    <h2>2️⃣ Live Coding Round (Online)</h2>
    <p>This round was conducted online. I was given a buggy code and had to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Debug the code</li>
      <li>Fix all issues</li>
      <li>Push the corrected version to GitHub</li>
      <li>Submit within <strong>1 hour 30 minutes</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>✅ I successfully cleared this round!</p>

    <h2>3️⃣ Technical Interview</h2>
    <p>I received a call from HR two hours later informing me that I was selected for the technical round. The interview was challenging and covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Swift Basics</li>
      <li>✅ MVVM Architecture</li>
      <li>✅ OOP Concepts</li>
      <li>✅ Stacks & Data Structures</li>
      <li>✅ Difference between <strong>Class & Struct</strong></li>
      <li>✅ Friend Functions</li>
      <li>✅ Nil & Optional Values</li>
      <li>✅ My iOS Projects</li>
      <li>✅ API Integration & Firebase</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>SwiftUI</strong> (major focus!)</li>
      <li>✅ Extensions in Swift</li>
    </ul>
    <p>❌ I couldn’t answer a few questions confidently, which led to my rejection in this round.</p>

    <h2>4️⃣ Final HR Round (Not Qualified)</h2>
    <p>Since I didn’t clear the technical round, I wasn’t eligible for the HR round. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>💡 I was among only <strong>5 candidates</strong> who cleared the live coding round.</li>
      <li>🧑‍🎓 All others were graduates — I’m still in my final year!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This was a fantastic learning experience for me. Although I didn’t make it to the final round, I gained:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 Confidence in my Swift & SwiftUI skills</li>
      <li>📈 Motivation to keep learning and improving</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To all aspiring iOS developers: <strong>Keep learning, keep coding, and never be afraid of challenges!</strong> 🚀</p>
