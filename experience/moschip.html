  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>MOSCHIP</strong> was the first company that visited our campus for placement. It offered a <strong>₹9000 stipend</strong> with the possibility of a <strong>Pre-Placement Offer (PPO)</strong>. The available roles were divided into <strong>technical</strong> and <strong>non-technical</strong> positions, with locations in Pune and Ahmedabad.</p>

    <h2>📝 Assessment Round</h2>
    <p>I was shortlisted for the <strong>assessment round</strong> and appeared for it. After two days, the results were declared — I was among the students selected for the interview process.</p>

    <p>From the entire batch, <strong>50 students</strong> were shortlisted for the interview. Based on roles, we were divided into respective categories. I appeared for the <strong>technical interview</strong>.</p>

    <h2>💼 Interview Experience</h2>
    <p>The interview was more than moderate in terms of difficulty. Here's what was covered:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>✅ <strong>Data Structures:</strong> General questions and usage scenarios</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>C Programming:</strong> Focused on functions like <code>malloc()</code> and <code>calloc()</code>, and where these are used in memory management</li>
      <li>✅ <strong>Project Discussion:</strong> I was asked to explain and draw the architecture of my mobile application development project</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I successfully explained my app’s structure and UI flow, and the interviewers seemed happy with my clarity and presentation. They appreciated my diagram and approach.</p>

    <h2>🎓 Academic Question</h2>
    <p>Finally, I was asked about a subject from my last semester. Initially, I panicked and couldn't recall it for about 5 minutes, but later I remembered and gave the correct answer.</p>

    <h2>🚫 Outcome</h2>
    <p>Despite performing decently and impressing the panel with my project explanation, I was <strong>not selected</strong> in the final list. However, it was a valuable learning experience.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This experience taught me the importance of being calm under pressure and being well-prepared with academic subjects. I also realized how crucial it is to explain projects with clarity and confidence — something that worked in my favor during this interview.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip for others:</strong> Practice explaining your projects and brush up on both coding and academic subjects. Always stay confident and composed, even when you momentarily forget something.</p>
