    <h1>📝 My Interview Experience at Avali Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</h1>
    <p>📍 Campus Placement | DY Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri</p>
  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>Avali Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</strong> from Bengaluru visited our college for campus placements. The selection process consisted of multiple rounds, and I was fortunate to be shortlisted for all of them.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Step 1: Coding Assessment (Offline)</h2>
    <p>The assessment was conducted in our college lab. It included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>6 questions total</li>
      <li><strong>2 SQL queries</strong></li>
      <li><strong>4 programming problems</strong> (DSA-related)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I cleared the assessment successfully and was selected for the next round – the technical interview.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Step 2: Technical Interview (Online)</h2>
    <p>This round was held online through the college Training & Placement department. I was asked the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explanation of my project</li>
      <li>One DSA question: <strong>Avogadro number problem</strong></li>
      <li>Array question</li>
      <li>String manipulation problem</li>
      <li>Linked list operation</li>
      <li>One puzzle: <strong>“Two Candle Puzzle”</strong> – I solved it within 5 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was one of the most balanced and enjoyable interviews I had.</p>

    <h2>💼 Step 3: HR Round</h2>
    <p>The HR round was a bit different – focused more on general knowledge than technical or behavioral questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is GST?</li>
      <li>What is CGST?</li>
      <li>Who is the Prime Minister of India?</li>
      <li>What is the capital of India?</li>
      <li>What is the economic capital of India?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I confidently answered all the questions.</p>

    <h2>📉 Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>Despite performing well in all rounds, my name was not in the final selection list. It was disappointing, but I still consider this one of the best interview experiences due to the quality of questions and interaction.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This interview helped boost my confidence and sharpened my DSA and general knowledge preparation. Sometimes even good performances don’t lead to selection due to limited seats, but every interview adds valuable learning.</p>
