    <p><strong>6D Technologies</strong>, a telecommunications product company headquartered in Bangalore, visited our college for a campus recruitment drive. I was <strong>shortlisted based on my resume</strong> and invited for the interview process.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 1: Online Technical Interview</h2>
    <p>This round was conducted online and involved a mix of coding and theoretical questions. The questions were mainly basic to medium level. Here's what they asked:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>🧮 Coding questions: Basic level</li>
      <li>🧠 C Programming:
        <ul>
          <li>What is <code>if-else</code>?</li>
          <li>How does <code>switch-case</code> work?</li>
          <li>Usage of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code></li>
          <li>What is a <code>static</code> keyword?</li>
          <li>What is a <code>friend</code> function?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>💡 OOP Concepts: Basic definitions and examples</li>
      <li>🗄️ MySQL:
        <ul>
          <li>Difference between <strong>DDL</strong> and <strong>DML</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The overall interview was quite balanced — <strong>not too hard</strong>, and most questions were based on <strong>fundamentals</strong>. A good understanding of C, OOP, and basic SQL is sufficient for cracking this kind of interview.</p>
