    <h1>🚀 My Interview Experience at Xalta – iOS/Software Intern Role</h1>
    <p>Campus Referral | Computer Engineering Department | Final Year</p>
  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>The opportunity with <strong>Xalta</strong> came through my college’s <strong>Training and Placement Department</strong>, which forwarded my resume directly to the company’s HR team along with a few other students from our Computer Department.</p>

    <h2>🧩 Interview Experience</h2>
    <p>I was shortlisted for the direct interview round. Here's how it went:</p>

    <h3>1️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
    <p>The interviewer started with simple OOP questions, focusing on core concepts. I was also asked to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Create a class</li>
      <li>✅ Perform basic operations on objects</li>
      <li>✅ Explain concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2️⃣ MySQL</h3>
    <p>The next set of questions involved SQL queries and theoretical database concepts. Topics included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔍 What is a <strong>cursor</strong> in SQL?</li>
      <li>🔍 What is an <strong>index</strong> and how does it help?</li>
      <li>🧠 Writing basic SQL queries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3️⃣ Array Logic Problem</h3>
    <p>Then I was given an interesting array question:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Given an array that stores only <code>1</code> and <code>-1</code>, arrange or maintain it in such a way that the sum of all elements becomes <strong>0</strong>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>I attempted this problem using logic-based reasoning to balance the count of 1’s and -1’s.</p>

    <h3>4️⃣ Python Questions</h3>
    <p>In the final part of the interview, the interviewer asked me a few Python-related questions. However, since I am not proficient in Python, I couldn’t answer them effectively.</p>

    <h2>🚫 Outcome</h2>
    <p>Although I did well in OOP, MySQL, and logic problems, my lack of experience in Python affected my performance in the final section.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This interview taught me the importance of language flexibility and being prepared for multi-language questions in interviews. I plan to explore Python basics moving forward, while continuing to strengthen my OOP and problem-solving skills.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip for juniors:</strong> Focus not only on your preferred language but also be open to other common industry languages like Python and Java. It can increase your chances in technical interviews!</p>
