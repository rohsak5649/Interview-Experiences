    <p>I recently attended the interview process at <strong>Revature</strong>, a company that offers training and development programs and connects talent with client companies for real-world projects.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Round 1: Logical & Aptitude Assessment</h2>
    <p>The first round was an online assessment focused on <strong>logical reasoning</strong> and <strong>aptitude</strong> skills. It tested analytical thinking, basic mathematics, and problem-solving speed. I successfully cleared this round.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 2: Technical Assessment</h2>
    <p>This round tested <strong>technical knowledge</strong> related to programming fundamentals and basic computer science concepts. Clearing this round led me to the interview phase.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ HR Interview</h2>
    <p>The final interview was HR-based and revolved around my background and personality. Some of the questions included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📘 What is your educational background?</li>
      <li>💼 How many companies have you applied to or interviewed with?</li>
      <li>💪 What are your strengths?</li>
      <li>📉 What are your weaknesses?</li>
      <li>🎓 What is your CGPA?</li>
      <li>🏆 What extracurricular activities have you participated in?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interview mainly focused on understanding my career goals and how well I would fit into Revature's training and client-based deployment model.</p>

    <h2>📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Revature offers a unique opportunity by providing training along with placement in client companies. The process was structured and smooth, and it helped me reflect more deeply on my own strengths and direction.</p>
