  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>Siemens</strong> visited our college for a campus placement drive. The process started with a proctored online assessment, followed by a detailed technical interview.</p>

    <h2>📝 Round 1: Online Assessment</h2>
    <p>The assessment was conducted on a <strong>multi-browser platform</strong> and could be taken from home or college. I appeared from home, and after successfully clearing it, I was shortlisted for the interview.</p>

    <p>Only <strong>8 students from my college</strong> made it to the interview round.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 2: Technical Interview</h2>
    <p>The interview was taken by a female software engineer and lasted for almost <strong>1 hour</strong>. The focus of the interview was mostly on my project and object-oriented programming concepts.</p>

    <p>Key topics discussed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎨 Figma and UI/UX fundamentals (based on my project)</li>
      <li>📱 Swift and SwiftUI</li>
      <li>🗃️ SQLite and MySQL – including SQL query writing</li>
      <li>🧠 Object-Oriented Programming – deep conceptual questions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The interviewer was especially focused on <strong>OOP concepts</strong> and tested my knowledge in great detail. I was able to answer about <strong>80% of the questions</strong> confidently.</p>

    <h2>📌 Final Status</h2>
    <p>Despite performing well and expecting a positive outcome, my name wasn’t in the final selection list. This was disappointing, but the interview itself was one of the best learning experiences I’ve had.</p>

    <h2>💡 Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This interview taught me that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧩 <strong>OOP and SQL</strong> cover nearly 70% of technical questions in such interviews.</li>
      <li>🎯 Even if the result is not in your favor, every experience adds value to your preparation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>My Advice:</strong> For companies like Siemens, focus deeply on <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> and <strong>SQL queries</strong> — they play a critical role in your evaluation.</p>
