    <h1>📝 My Interview Experience at Portway International</h1>
    <p>📍 Campus Placement | DY Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri</p>
  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>Portway International came to our college for a campus placement drive. The process started with two offline, pen-paper based rounds:</p>

    <h2>🧪 Step 1: Aptitude Test (Offline)</h2>
    <p>The first round was an aptitude test conducted in-person. Around <strong>140 students</strong> appeared for this round.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Step 2: Python Test (Offline)</h2>
    <p>After the aptitude test, a Python programming test was conducted, again on paper. Based on both test performances, only <strong>5 students</strong> were shortlisted for the interview round. I was proud to be one of them.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ Technical Interview</h2>
    <p>The interview was conducted in-person at our own campus. The panel asked a variety of questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detailed explanation of my project</li>
      <li>Questions on MySQL and database concepts</li>
      <li>SQLite-related queries</li>
      <li>Node.js and Express.js – some technical questions</li>
      <li>Two coding problems (which I solved correctly)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📉 Final Outcome</h2>
    <p>Although I answered <strong>about 80% of the questions correctly</strong>, I was not selected for the final HR round. From the 5 shortlisted students, only 1 was selected to proceed further.</p>

    <p>I still don’t know the exact reason for not being selected, but I took it positively and used it as motivation to improve further.</p>

    <h2>💡 Learning</h2>
    <p>This experience taught me that clearing written and even technical interviews doesn’t always guarantee a selection. Sometimes companies have very limited seats, or are looking for a very specific skill set. Still, I gave my best and it boosted my confidence in facing offline interviews and paper-based coding rounds.</p>
