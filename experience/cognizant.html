    <h1>🚀 My Interview Experience at Cognizant – Campus Placement</h1>
    <p>On-Campus | Final Year Computer Engineering | Cognizant Software Role</p>
  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>Cognizant</strong> visited our college for campus placements, and I was excited to participate in the process. Here's my experience through each stage of the selection:</p>

    <h2>1️⃣ Screening Round</h2>
    <p>I cleared the initial **screening round**, which was used to shortlist candidates based on academic records and eligibility.</p>

    <h2>2️⃣ Communication Round</h2>
    <p>This round was focused on testing English comprehension, grammar, and communication fluency. I cleared this round successfully.</p>

    <h2>3️⃣ Online Assessment</h2>
    <p>The assessment round was quite comprehensive and included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ 2 Coding Problems</li>
      <li>✅ 2 MySQL Queries</li>
      <li>✅ 1 Frontend Task using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was able to solve almost 90% of this round, which helped me get shortlisted for the interview.</p>

    <h2>4️⃣ Technical + HR Interview</h2>
    <p>The interview panel asked me about my preferred programming language. They gave me the choice between <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, but I confidently told them that I specialize in <strong>C++</strong>.</p>

    <p>They asked me questions from both **Java** and **C++**, covering topics like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ OOPS Concepts – Inheritance, Polymorphism, Overloading & Overriding</li>
      <li>✅ Differences between Class, Object, and Struct</li>
      <li>✅ Code writing for Arrays and Strings</li>
      <li>✅ Basic and intermediate <strong>DSA</strong> problems</li>
      <li>✅ SQL – I confidently answered all questions and scored a perfect 100/100</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚫 Outcome</h2>
    <p>Although I did well in MySQL and general programming, I couldn’t answer some Java-based and DSA questions due to less familiarity. Since the company required strength in Java, I wasn’t selected in the final round.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This experience taught me how crucial it is to be flexible with programming languages in company-specific scenarios. While I was confident in C++, the interviewers expected some level of Java proficiency.</p>

    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> If you're preparing for product-based or service-based companies like Cognizant, make sure to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📘 Know OOPS deeply (across multiple languages)</li>
      <li>📚 Practice DSA and SQL consistently</li>
      <li>🧠 Be ready for frontend and backend assessments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Though I didn’t get selected, this interview experience boosted my confidence and clarified where I need to improve. 🚀</p>
