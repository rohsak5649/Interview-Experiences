    <h1>🚀 My Interview Experience at Namekart – iOS Developer Intern</h1>
    <p>Off-Campus | 3rd Year, 2nd Semester | Final Year Computer Engineering Student</p>

    <p>During my third year (second semester), I appeared for an off-campus interview process with <strong>Namekart</strong> for the position of <strong>iOS Application Developer Intern</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1️⃣ Shortlisting & Online Test</h2>
    <p>I was shortlisted by the company and received a test link to appear for the first round. The test focused on general iOS development knowledge, logical thinking, and coding basics.</p>

    <h2>2️⃣ Technical Interview</h2>
    <p>After successfully completing the test, I received an email for the next round: the <strong>Technical Interview</strong>. Topics covered included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ iOS basics (Swift, View lifecycle, UIKit/SwiftUI)</li>
      <li>✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts</li>
      <li>✅ Data Structures (Array, Linked List, String manipulation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interviewer assessed both my coding logic and fundamental understanding of development principles.</p>

    <h2>3️⃣ HR Round</h2>
    <p>I reached the HR round, where we discussed my academic journey and internship expectations. However, the company was specifically looking for final-year students who had already completed their degree.</p>

    <h2>🚫 Outcome</h2>
    <p>Since I was still in the third year at that time, I wasn’t selected. However, reaching this stage gave me valuable experience and boosted my confidence.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This opportunity helped me understand the structure of a real interview process: test → technical → HR. I realized the importance of DSA, OOP concepts, and iOS fundamentals in interviews.</p>

    <p><strong>Advice for students:</strong> Keep practicing iOS concepts, DSA, and mock interviews — even if you don’t meet all eligibility criteria now, you’ll be ready when the time comes! 💪📱</p>
