    <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to interview at <strong>FRND</strong> for an iOS Developer Intern role. This was my second interview after facing rejection from Jar, and it turned out to be a valuable learning experience that emphasized the importance of consistent practice and deep exploration of iOS technologies.</p>

    <h2>📋 Interview Experience</h2>
    <p>The interview was relatively easy and focused on fundamental iOS concepts. Topics covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Swift concepts</li>
      <li>✅ MVVM architecture</li>
      <li>✅ State & Binding in SwiftUI</li>
      <li>✅ CoreData</li>
      <li>✅ My previous iOS internship project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>⚠️ However, due to limited advanced practice, I felt I could’ve done better.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>At the end of the interview, I asked the interviewer:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>💡 "What are the essential skills for an iOS Developer Intern or Fresher?"</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Their advice was simple yet powerful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔹 Maintain consistency in coding</li>
      <li>🔹 Practice daily on <strong>Xcode Playground</strong></li>
      <li>🔹 Learn a new concept every day and <strong>implement</strong> it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This experience reinforced the value of <strong>continuous learning</strong>. Although I didn’t secure the offer, I gained insights that will shape my preparation going forward.</p>

    <p>💡💻 If you're preparing for iOS roles, remember: <strong>Consistency is key.</strong> Let's grow together!</p>
