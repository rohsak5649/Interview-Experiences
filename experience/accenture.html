  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>Accenture</strong> visited our college for a <strong>campus placement drive</strong>. I was shortlisted for the initial assessment, which was conducted in our college’s computer lab.</p>

    <h2>📝 Assessment Round</h2>
    <p>The assessment included multiple sections such as aptitude, logical reasoning, and verbal ability. After clearing these sections, I was shortlisted for the next round — <strong>coding</strong>.</p>

    <h2>💻 Coding Round</h2>
    <p>In the coding round, there were two questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔹 One <strong>medium-level</strong> coding question</li>
      <li>🔹 One <strong>hard-level</strong> coding question</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I successfully solved both problems and was selected for the next round — <strong>communication round</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ Communication Round</h2>
    <p>This round focused on:
      <ul>
        <li>✅ English fluency</li>
        <li>✅ Grammar</li>
        <li>✅ Sentence formation and listening comprehension</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After clearing the communication round, I received an email to schedule my interview. I chose my slot on <strong>11th September</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🤝 Interview Experience</h2>
    <p>The interview was mainly HR-based and went very well — I would say around <strong>95% good</strong>. The interviewer asked me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Tell me about yourself</li>
      <li>✅ What are your hobbies?</li>
      <li>✅ Tell me about your college extracurriculars</li>
      <li>✅ Any experience with college clubs or sports?</li>
      <li>✅ Your family background</li>
      <li>✅ Situational and conditional-type questions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The overall experience was very smooth and friendly. I felt confident during the conversation and shared all answers genuinely.</p>

    <h2>📌 Final Status</h2>
    <p>As of now, the <strong>results are pending</strong>. Not only for me but also for all students who appeared for the interview. Hoping for a positive outcome!</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>This interview helped me gain confidence in communication rounds and HR-style conversations. Whether selected or not, the experience was valuable and uplifting.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip for others:</strong> Practice speaking clearly, stay confident, and be honest during HR interviews. Sometimes, your personality makes the strongest impression.</p>
