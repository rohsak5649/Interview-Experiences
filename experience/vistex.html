    <h1>🚀 My Interview Experience at Vistex – Campus Placement</h1>
    <p>📍 In-Person Interview at Mumbai | College Campus Drive</p>
  </header>

  <main style="padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p><strong>Vistex</strong> visited our college for a campus recruitment drive. The process was structured with an initial <strong>MCQ-based assessment</strong>, followed by two rounds of technical interviews held at the <strong>Vistex office in Andheri West, Mumbai</strong>.</p>

    <h2>📝 Round 1: Online Assessment</h2>
    <p>The first step was a multiple-choice question (MCQ) assessment focusing on technical fundamentals. I successfully cleared this round and was shortlisted for the interview.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 2: Technical Interview – Round 1</h2>
    <p>This round included fundamental programming and technical questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ HTML basics</li>
      <li>✅ MySQL queries</li>
      <li>✅ String reversal</li>
      <li>✅ Array reversal and addition</li>
      <li>✅ Linear search and binary search algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was able to confidently solve all these and cleared the first technical round.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 3: Technical Interview – Round 2</h2>
    <p>After clearing the first round, only a few candidates were shortlisted — I was one of them. The second round involved deeper computer science fundamentals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔹 Concepts of <strong>trees</strong> and <strong>graphs</strong> (theory-based problem-solving)</li>
      <li>🔹 Binary Search Trees (BST): how they work and operations</li>
      <li>🔹 Questions on <strong>multithreading</strong></li>
      <li>🔹 A moderate-level SQL query</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I answered most of the questions well, and the interview went smoothly.</p>

    <h2>📌 Final Status</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, I was not selected in the final list. The company followed a policy of selecting <strong>only one candidate per college</strong>. A friend of mine from the same college was selected.</p>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Even though I wasn’t selected, I felt confident and satisfied with my performance in both technical rounds. This experience sharpened my understanding of core topics like arrays, SQL, and data structures like trees and graphs.</p>

    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> For companies like Vistex, focus on writing clean logic for basic problems and also be thorough with theoretical concepts of data structures and SQL.</p>
