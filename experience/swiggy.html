    <h1>🟠 My Interview Experience with Swiggy – iOS Developer Intern 📱🚀</h1>

    <p>I recently had the opportunity to interview with <strong>Swiggy</strong> for an iOS Developer Intern position, and I wanted to share my experience — hoping it helps others who are preparing for similar roles.</p>

    <h2>✅ Round 1: Coding Round</h2>
    <p>The process started with a coding round focused on problem-solving using basic data structures and algorithms. After successfully clearing this, I was shortlisted for the next stage.</p>

    <h2>💻 Round 2: Technical Interview (R1)</h2>
    <p>This round was centered around iOS development topics. The interviewer asked me questions based on <strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>SwiftUI</strong>, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Swift language fundamentals</li>
      <li>Views and layout in SwiftUI</li>
      <li>Navigation and State management</li>
      <li>MVVM architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>✅ I confidently answered around <strong>90%</strong> of the questions!</p>

    <h2>📊 Round 3: DSA-focused Interview</h2>
    <p>This round involved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic DSA questions</li>
      <li>Medium-level coding problems</li>
      <li>Dynamic Programming (DP) challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🧠 I handled the easy and medium problems well, but found about <strong>70%</strong> of the DP questions difficult to understand.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Even for an <strong>internship role</strong>, companies like Swiggy expect a solid understanding of <strong>DSA</strong> along with strong <strong>platform-specific knowledge</strong> such as iOS development.</p>

    <p>📚 This experience reminded me to continue improving my skills in both:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Swift & SwiftUI</li>
      <li>✅ Data Structures & Algorithms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To all fellow iOS developers and students: <strong>Keep practicing both development and problem-solving. Both are crucial in cracking interviews at top tech companies!</strong> 💪</p>
